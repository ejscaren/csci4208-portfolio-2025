<h3>Reflections</h3>
<br><hr><br>
After completing the dodger game this lab was no problem. The only problem I encountered was a problem with colliding with the end goal. I found out it had to do with me creating the collisions
first and then creating the end goal. I had similar problems with creating certain aspects of the game in the wrong order but had no problems with code. 
I much prefer this game to the dodger game as there is much more room to work and create. The dodger only really had one frame to work with. I will say, however, the dodger was more difficult to play and win.
