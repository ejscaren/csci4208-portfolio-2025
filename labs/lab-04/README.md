<h2>Reflection</h2>

<br><hr><br>

<p>What I did in this lab was design a mini-game where you must guess a number between 0 and 999. After each guess
you get a hint that tells you if your guess was to high or too low. Most of it was basic java and I was just learning how to 
get java and html to connect. What really interested me was how the countdown was implemented. The recursive calling of the main function 
was something I had not seen before and will duly note it.</p>
