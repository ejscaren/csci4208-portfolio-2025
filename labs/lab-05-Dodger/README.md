<h3>Reflection</h3>

This lab was the most difficult so far. Multiple times throughout I encountered problems with the code in the pdf that would run into errors. 2 issues that were particularly hard were the projectiles array in the attack function and the entire powerups part. 
<br><br>
1. The projectiles array would not recognize the projectile object that I was trying to push in the attack function. I kept getting an error and later found out I needed to rearrange lines of code to fix this. 
<br><br>
2. The powerups part code just looked like it didn't work. I inputed some code of my own in the spawn powerups function so I could properly spawn and collect the powerups.
<br><br>
All in all it was a cool project to be able to create a game in html and its a step in the direction I want to go into, but this is the first lab I have done that I don't feel confident that I could reproduce something similar.
The phaser.js file in particular was very confusing.
